play-quote-search
=================

Basically my first time messing about with CGI programming, this gets a play
from some kind of file (whatever I could find), and dumps everything said by
a user-given character name. It tries to be simple enough for an English Lit
student to use comfortably, but what do I know about these things.

I'm fairly certain I ended up sort of 'patching' the "'Tis Pity She's a Whore"
files, but I can't for the life of me find the file I used to do it with. I'll
try and get the script running without needing this.

For Shakespare, a much better alternative is [Open-Source Shakespeare](http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=midsummer).
