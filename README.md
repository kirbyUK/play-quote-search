Basically my first time messing about with CGI programming, this gets a play
from some kind of file (whatever I could find), and dumps everything said by
a user-given character name. It tries to be simple enough for an English Lit
student to use comfortably, but what do I know about these things.

The files required for all the scripts are given in the comments of the scripts.
The scripts are designed so that they can work straight on the files with no
modifications, though the 'Tis Pity one requires unzipping first.

For Shakespeare, a much better alternative is [Open-Source Shakespeare](http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=midsummer).
